#  What is Lucky Double?

Lucky Double is an online casino game that offers players the chance to win big payouts. The game is played by betting on the outcome of a coin flip, and players can choose to bet on either heads or tails. If they correctly predict the outcome of the flip, they will win a payout based on their initial bet.

The Lucky Double game is available to play for free or for real money, and there are a range of different betting options available. Players can choose to bet as little as €0.01 or as much as €100 per flip, and there is a potential jackpot of €10,000 up for grabs.

# How to Play Lucky Double

To play Lucky Double, players first need to decide how much they want to bet on each flip. They can then choose whether to bet on heads or tails by clicking on the relevant box. Once they have made their selection, they need to hit the ‘Flip Coin’ button to start the game.
