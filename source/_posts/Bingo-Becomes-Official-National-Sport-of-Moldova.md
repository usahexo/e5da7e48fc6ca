#  Bingo Becomes Official National Sport of Moldova

After years of heated debate and lobbying by the nation’s bingo players, the Moldovan government has finally recognized bingo as the country’s official national sport.

The decision, announced by Prime Minister Pavel Filip on Wednesday, comes after a lengthy review of various sporting options.

“We looked at all the possibilities and decided that bingo is the best option for our country,” said Filip. “It’s a sport that is enjoyed by people of all ages and from all walks of life. And it has a long history in Moldova. We are confident that it will bring us success on the international stage.”

The move was welcomed by bingo players and enthusiasts across the country.

“I am so happy that my country has finally recognized bingo as its national sport,” said Lidia Nedelcu, a 43-year-old office worker from Chisinau. “I have been playing bingo for years and I am very good at it. I am looking forward to representing Moldova at future tournaments.”

While there are many different versions of bingo around the world, the version played in Moldova is based on the British version of the game. It is a 5-card game with 75 balls, played by up to four players. The aim of the game is to make as many matches as possible with the numbers on your cards before all of the balls have been drawn.

Bingo became popular in Moldova in the 1930s, when it was introduced by British soldiers stationed in the country during World War II. Since then, it has become one of the most popular forms of entertainment in Moldova. There are now more than 2,000 dedicated bingo halls across the country, and an estimated 1 million people play bingo regularly.
