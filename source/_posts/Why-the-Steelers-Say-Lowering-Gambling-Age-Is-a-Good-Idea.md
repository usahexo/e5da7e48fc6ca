#  Why the Steelers Say Lowering Gambling Age Is a Good Idea

Pittsburgh Steelers owner Art Rooney II said he believes the NFL should lobby for a lowering of the gambling age to 18, in an interview with the Associated Press.

“I think that if we can have more people in this country participating in legal sports betting, it will be a positive thing,” Rooney said.

The Steelers owner made his comments one day after the US Supreme Court struck down a 1992 law that barred most state-authorized sports gambling.

Rooney is not alone in his thinking. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has also voiced support for legalizing sports betting.

“I think it’s something that we have to consider given the popularity of betting on sports, and I think there’s certainly an argument that can be made that it should be legalized and regulated,” Silver said in an interview last year.

Many experts believe that legalizing sports betting could generate up to $5 billion in annual revenue. That could help states facing budget deficits and struggling casinos.

But there are also concerns about how widespread gambling could become and its impact on athletes and the games themselves. The NFL has been especially vocal about its opposition to expanding legal gambling, citing its commitment to keeping the game “fraud-free.”

The issue of gambling is a complicated one and it is likely that there will be continued debate about its pros and cons even after it is legalized in more states. But with such a large potential for financial gain, it is clear why those in favor of legalization are pushing hard for it to happen.

#  NFL Team Argues That 18-Year-Olds Should Be Able to Gamble

The NFL is currently arguing that 18-year-olds should be allowed to gamble on sports. The organization has filed a legal brief in support of New Jersey’s efforts to overturn a federal ban on sports betting.

“The NFL believes that the current prohibition on sports gambling is unconstitutional and that New Jersey should be able to offer its citizens legal and regulated sports betting,” said NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy.

This isn’t the first time that the NFL has taken a stance on this issue. In 2011, the league unsuccessfully fought to overturn the federal ban. However, with the recent legalization of gambling in other states, the NFL has decided to take another shot at it.

There are a few reasons why the NFL is pushing for this change. First, it could help to increase fan engagement. In addition, legalized sports betting could provide a new source of revenue for the league.

Not everyone agrees with the NFL’s position on this issue. Some people argue that 18-year-olds are not mature enough to make informed decisions about gambling. Others worry that legalized sports betting could lead to increased incidents of match fixing.

Despite these concerns, the NFL is hoping to persuade Congress to repeal the federal ban on sports betting.

#  Pittsburgh Steelers Believe That Gambling Should Be Available to 18, 19, and 20 Year Olds

The Pittsburgh Steelers feel that gambling should be available to 18, 19, and 20 year olds. This is a stance that they have taken in light of the recent Supreme Court decision to legalize sports betting.

There are a few reasons why the Steelers believe this. For starters, they feel that it is important for young people to have access to gambling in order to learn how to gamble responsibly. They also feel that allowing young people to gamble will help to create new jobs and economic opportunities in the country. Finally, they believe that it is important for young people to have access to gambling in order to generate new tax revenue for the government.

While there are some who may disagree with the Steelers’ stance on this issue, the fact remains that they are one of the most respected franchises in all of professional sports. And, as always, they will continue to put their fans first.

#  Let Younger Adults Gamble – That's What the Steelers Are Advocating

The Pittsburgh Steelers, a professional American football team, have spoken out in favor of legalizing gambling for adults aged 18 to 21.

"This would allow younger adults the opportunity to gamble in a safe and responsible manner," said Steelers president Art Rooney II.

Rooney says that the team is "in full support of legislation that makes sense and protects the interests of all who participate in the gaming industry."

Many opponents of legalizing gambling for young adults argue that it would be harmful to their development, exposing them to addiction and other risks at too early an age. But Rooney counters that by pointing to the many states where gambling is already legal for adults aged 18 to 21, and noting that there has been no notable increase in addiction or problems among young gamblers in those states.

"If anything, providing a safe and regulated environment for young people to gamble in may actually help reduce addiction rates," said Rooney. "We believe that this is a common-sense issue, and we are urging state legislators to support it."

#  Steelers Want to Allow 18-Year-olds to Gamble in order to Combat Gambling addiction

The Steelers are looking to allow 18-year-olds to gamble in order to combat gambling addiction, which has been on the rise in the United States.

The NFL team is working with state legislators to draft a proposal that would legalize gambling for people who are 18 and older. The purpose of the legislation is to help people who are addicted to gambling, as well as to generate revenue for the state.

"It's an addiction and it's ruining people's lives," said Steelers owner Art Rooney II. "We want to do whatever we can to help those people, and this seems like a good way to do it."

Gambling addiction is a serious problem in the United States. According to statistics from the National Council on Problem Gambling, 2% of Americans have a gambling addiction, and another 4% are considered “problem gamblers”.

Those numbers are on the rise; in 2011, only 1.7% of Americans were addicted to gambling, and 3.4% were considered “problem gamblers”.

Many experts believe that legalizing gambling for people who are 18 and older would help reduce those numbers. They argue that it would be easier for addicted gamblers to get help if they could legally gamble at casinos or online poker sites.

"If you make it illegal, people will just find other ways to gamble," said one expert. "But if you legalize it, you can create regulations that will protect people from getting addicted."

Revenue from legalized gambling could also be used to help treat gambling addiction. In Nevada, for example, $9 million was set aside last year for gambling addiction treatment programs.

Some skeptics argue that legalized gambling would lead to more problems than it solves. They say that legalizing gambling would increase crime rates and bankrupt state governments.

But supporters of legalized gambling argue that those concerns are overblown. They point out that many states already have legalized gambling, and that none of them have gone bankrupt as a result.
