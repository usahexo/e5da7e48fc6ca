#  FC Köln boosts revenue by setting up sports betting business

FC Köln has announced that it will be setting up a sports betting business in order to boost revenue. The club, which is one of the most popular in Germany, plans to use the new venture to increase its income by up to €10 million per year.

The move is a response to the German Football League’s (DFL) decision to allow sports betting on professional football matches from next season. This will give the country’s 36 clubs the opportunity to generate extra revenue through sponsorship and advertising deals with betting companies.

FC Köln has already entered into a partnership with Oddset, the official state-owned betting company in Schleswig-Holstein. The two parties have agreed a deal that will see Oddset become the main sponsor of the club’s jersey starting from next season. As part of the agreement, FC Köln will also promote Oddset’s brand at its stadium and within its own marketing materials.

#  FC Köln leads way in Bundesliga with successful sports betting business

FC Köln is a German association football club based in the city of Cologne. The club has been one of the most successful clubs in Germany since its beginnings in the early 1900s. After several close calls, FC Köln finally won its first Bundesliga title in 2014, which they successfully defended the following season. This article delves into how FC Köln became a powerhouse in German football and also how their sports betting business has helped contribute to their success.

The Origins of FC Köln

FC Köln was founded on 09 November 1948 as an amalgamation of two previous clubs, Sport Club vom “Ring” and Spielvereinigung Erftstadt. The new club played its first match on 02 December 1948 against Schwarz-Weiß Essen, losing 2-1. The early years were difficult for FC Köln, as they regularly fought relegation from the 2nd Bundesliga. However, in the early 1990s, fortunes changed for the club and they achieved promotion to the top flight Bundesliga. Their stay there was short-lived as they were relegated after just one season, but they bounced back immediately and have been a mainstay in Germany’s top division since then.

FC Köln’s Recent Success

In recent years, FC Köln has become one of the most successful clubs in Germany. They won their first Bundesliga title in 2014 and followed that up with another championship win in 2015. They also reached the final of the DFB-Pokal (German Cup) in 2016, but lost to Borussia Dortmund 2-4. FC Köln is currently managed by Peter Stöger and has some of the most talented players in Germany, including Timo Horn, Jonas Hector and Leonardo Bittencourt.

How FC Köln Became a Sports Betting Powerhouse



In addition to being one of Germany’s most successful football clubs, FC Köln is also a powerhouse when it comes to sports betting. The club operates two betting shops called “FC NetCologne” and “FC Cologne Sportwetten” and generated over €17 million in revenue from these shops in 2017 alone. This makes FC Köln one of the most profitable clubs in Europe when it comes to sports betting income. In fact, only eight other clubs generate more income from sports betting operations than FC Köln does.

What Makes FC Köln So Successful at Sports Betting?

There are several reasons why FC Köln has been so successful at sports betting. Firstly, the club has a large fanbase that is spread all across Germany. This fanbase provides a large customer base for the club’s betting shops. Secondly, FCK has enjoyed sustained success over the past few years both on and off the pitch which has led to an increase in demand for their betting services. Lastly, the management team at FCK understands how to run a successful sports betting business and have been able to maximise profits from their shops accordingly.
