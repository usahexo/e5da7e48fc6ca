# Texas Hold'em Poker Hand Rankings - The Complete Guide

Texas hold'em is a popular poker game that is played around the world. The game is typically played with a deck of 52 cards, and the aim of the game is to create the best five card hand. In this guide, we will take a look at the different hand rankings in Texas hold'em, from worst to best.

One important thing to note about Texas hold'em hand rankings is that they are not static - they can change depending on the suit of the cards. For example, a flush is always better than a straight, regardless of the rank of the cards. With that in mind, let's take a look at the hand rankings in Texas hold'em:

1. High card - This is the weakest hand possible in Texas hold'em, and it consists of any five cards which do not form any other ranked combination.

2. One pair - This hand consists of two cards of the same rank, plus three additional cards which are not of the same rank.

3. Two pair - This hand consists of two different pairs of cards, plus one additional card which is not of either pair.

4. Three of a kind - This hand consists of three cards of the same rank, plus two additional card which are not of the same rank.

5. Straight - This hand consists of five consecutive cards which are not all of the same suit. An Ace can be used as either high or low for a straight, but it cannot be used as both (e.g. A2345).

6. Flush - This hand consists of five cards all of the same suit . If two players have a flush, then the player with the highest ranked card within the flush wins (e.g A2345 would beats KQJT). If both players have identically ranked flushes, then the pot is split evenly between them).

7. Full house - This hand consists three cards of one rank and two as another rank (e.g 3456 would be a full house). If two players have a full house then whoever has higher ranking triplet (the three matching cards) would win (e g 3465 would beat 2346). If both sets if triples are equal then whoever has more pairs would win (e g 3456 would beat 4555).


8 Four-of-a-kind - This hand consists four cards with matching rank and one other card . If two players have four-of-a-kinds then whoever has higher ranking four-of-a-kinds wins .If both players have identical fours-of-a-kinds , then whoever has highest fifth card wins .

9 Straight Flush -This hand consist six consecutive suited cards . If two playersStraight Flush , then

10 Royal Flush –This is an unbeatable poker hands consisting ten consecutive suitedcAce through 10).

# How to Play Texas Holdem Poker - A Beginner's Guide

Texas Holdem Poker is the most popular type of poker in the world. It's a game that can be learned relatively easily, and provides plenty of opportunity for both winning and losing large sums of money.

In Texas Holdem Poker, each player is dealt two cards face down - these are called "hole" cards. After the hole cards have been dealt, three community cards are placed face up on the table - these are known as the "flop". The player with the best five card poker hand using any combination of their two hole cards and the five community cards will win the pot. If two or more players have the same best hand, the pot is split equally between them.

Once the flop has been dealt, a fourth community card is placed face up on the table - this is called the "turn". After the turn has been dealt, a fifth and final community card is placed face up on the table - this is called the "river".

Now let's take a look at an example hand:









The player with the best five card poker hand using any combination of their two hole cards and the five community cards will win the pot. In this example, player 1 has a pair of jacks (J♠ J♦) and player 2 has a pair of threes (3♥ 3♦). Since player 1's jacks are higher than player 2's threes, player 1 wins the pot.

# What Beats What in Poker - The Definitive List

In poker, as in any other card game, there are basic strategic principles that one can apply in order to make better decisions and give oneself a better chance of winning. But poker is not just a strategic game - it is also a game of probability, and as such, the outcome of any given situation is never certain. This means that even the best player in the world can lose to an inferior player if the cards dealt to them are not favourable.

Nevertheless, there are certain factors which tend to weigh more heavily in determining the outcome of a hand than others. In this article, we will take a look at some common scenarios that occur in poker and examine which option is more likely to result in victory.

One common scenario that arises in poker is when two players have similar hands - for example, both players may have a pair of eights. In this case, the decision between who wins and who loses usually comes down to luck. However, there are instances where one player has a better hand than the other even though their cards are not as good. For example, if one player has an ace-high flush and the other player has a two-pair, the player with the ace-high flush is almost always going to win.

Another scenario that often crops up in poker is when one player has a strong hand but their opponent has a chance of catching up with a draw. For example, if one player has four hearts and their opponent has three hearts and one spade, the player with four hearts will win if no more cards of that suit come up on the table. However, if another heart pops up on the turn or river card, then the opponent will catch up and potentially win the hand.

With all of that said, let's take a look at The Definitive List of what beats what in poker:

1) Royal flush beats all other hands
2) Straight flush beats four of a kind
3) Four of a kind beats full house
4) Full house beats flush
5) Flush beats straight
6) Straight beats three of a kind
7) Three of a kind beats two pairs
8) Two pairs beat one pair

# Poker Hand Rankings: Which Hands Win?

In poker, the best hand doesn't always win. In fact, there are many different possible outcomes in any given hand, and poker players must use their wits and strategy to come out on top.

Each player is dealt two cards at the beginning of a hand. The player with the highest-valued card is the one who starts the bidding, and from there, players must make decisions about which cards to keep and which ones to discard.

The goal of the game is to form the best five-card hand possible using any combination of the seven cards available to them (the two original cards and the five community cards). The best possible hand is a royal flush - an ace-high straight flush.

Below is a list of the ten most common winning poker hands, ranked in order from weakest to strongest:

#10) Two Pair
A two pair hand comprises two cards of equal rank plus two more cards of equal rank. For example, two queens and two sixes would constitute a two pair hand. This type of hand is generally weaker than most others, but it can still be victorious if played correctly.

#9) One Pair
A one pair hand comprises two cards of equal rank plus one more card of equal rank. For example, two queens and one king would constitute a one pair hand. This type of hand is generally weaker than most others, but it can still be victorious if played correctly.

#8) High Card
When no other hands are possible, the player with the highest-valued card in their original two-card hand wins the pot. In some cases (e.g., when players have identical high cards), the second-highest card may determine the winner. If both players have identical high and second-highest cards, then the pot will be split evenly between them.

# The Best 5 Poker Hands

In poker, the five best hands are as follows:

1. Royal flush
2. Straight flush
3. Four of a kind
4. Full house
5. Flush

A royal flush is the best possible hand in poker and is made up of the following cards: Ace, King, Queen, Jack, and Ten, all of the same suit. This hand is extremely rare and typically only occurs once every 649,740 hands.

A straight flush is next on the list and is made up of five consecutive cards of the same suit. This hand occurs approximately once every 72,192 hands.

Following a straight flush is four of a kind which occurs once every 4,164 hands on average. After four of a kind comes a full house which is made up of three of a kind and two different pairs. This hand occurs once every 694 hands on average. Finally, the fifth best hand in poker is a flush which is made up of any five cards of the same suit that are not in sequence. This hand occurs once every 143 hands on average.
