#  DraftKings Sports Betting Now Legal In Several States

Since the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the federal law prohibiting sports betting, a handful of states have moved to legalize the activity.

On Monday, Delaware became the first state to allow full-scale sports betting since the Supreme Court decision in May. Residents and tourists in the state can now place bets on professional and college sporting events at three casinos and online.

"This is a watershed moment for gaming in Delaware," said Governor John Carney. "We're excited to offer residents and visitors more choices when it comes to betting on their favorite teams."

Other states that have legalized sports betting since the Supreme Court decision include New Jersey, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania. Mississippi and Rhode Island are expected to follow suit in the coming weeks.

The American Gaming Association (AGA) estimates that Americans bet nearly $150 billion illegally on sporting events each year. The organization believes that legalizing and regulating sports betting will bring much of that business into the open, generating new tax revenue for states and creating jobs in the gaming industry.

"Sports betting is an important way to attract new customers and create jobs in our industry," said Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of the AGA. "We applaud the governors and legislatures in these states for taking action to provide consumers with a safe, legal option for sports betting."

#  DraftKings Moves Into Legal Sports Betting Space

DraftKings Inc., a popular online fantasy sports company, announced last week its plans to enter the legal sports betting space. The move comes as several U.S. states have opened up their sports betting markets in recent months.

The company said it has reached a partnership with European gaming provider DraftKings PLC to offer a new product – Sportsbook – later this year. The product will allow users to bet on professional and collegiate sporting events through the DraftKings website and mobile app.

"We are excited to introduce Sportsbook as we believe there is great potential in the market," Randy Mastro, head of operations for DraftKings, said in a statement. "This offering will provide our customers with another engaging way to experience sports and odds that they are not able to find elsewhere."

DraftKings' entrance into the sports betting market comes as no surprise; the company has been eyeing the space for some time now. Late last year, it acquired daily fantasy sports site BetMGM for an undisclosed amount. At the time, DraftKings CEO Jason Robins said that the move would allow his company to offer "a more holistic betting experience" to its customers.

Legal sports betting is currently available in a handful of states, including Nevada, New Jersey and West Virginia. But experts expect that number to grow quickly in the coming years, as more states move to legalize the activity.

For now, DraftKings is focusing its efforts on the U.S. market; it has no plans to offer Sportsbook in countries where online gambling is illegal.

#  DirectBet Acquires DraftKings Sports Betting License

In a move that could shake up the online sports betting industry, DirectBet has acquired a license to offer sports betting in the state of Massachusetts. This comes just weeks after the company announced it would be entering the U.S. market.

DirectBet is well known in the cryptocurrency world for being one of the first bitcoin-only sportsbooks. The company already allows customers to bet on a wide range of sporting events, including NFL, NBA, and NHL games.

With its new license, DirectBet will now be able to offer traditional bets such as point spreads and Money Line bets. In addition, the company plans to offer in-game betting and a wide range of props for major sporting events.

This news comes at a time when the online sports betting industry is experiencing rapid growth. According to research from H2 Gambling Capital, the global market for online sports betting is expected to grow from $30 billion in 2018 to $42 billion by 2023.

DirectBet is well positioned to take advantage of this growth thanks to its extensive experience in the cryptocurrency world. The company has been operating since 2013 and has processed over 78 million bets worth over $1 billion in total volume.

With its new license, DirectBet plans to aggressively expand its operations in the United States. The company has already announced plans to open a sales office in Boston and is currently hiring for key positions such as Chief Operating Officer and Chief Marketing Officer.

DirectBet expects its sports betting platform to be up and running in Massachusetts by early 2019.

The gambling firm William Hill has taken a stake in the daily fantasy sports site DraftKings, in a sign of confidence in the rapidly growing industry.

Daily fantasy sports sites have come under increasing scrutiny from state regulators in recent months, but William Hill evidently believes that there is still plenty of growth potential in the market. The company already operates its own daily fantasy sports site in the United States.

DraftKings raised $500 million in funding last year and is currently valued at around $2 billion. The company has been one of the leaders in thedaily fantasy sports space, but it has been challenged by smaller rivals such as FanDuel.

#  DraftKings Expands Into Nevada's Legal Sports Betting Market

DraftKings announced that it is expanding into Nevada's legal sports betting market. The company already operates in 10 states, but this will be its first foray into a state with legalized sports betting.

Nevada is one of the few states where sports betting is legal, and there are already many established operators in the market. DraftKings will have to compete with well-funded rivals such as MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment.

In a statement, DraftKings CEO Jason Robins said that the company is "thrilled" to be entering the Nevada market. He added that the company plans to "invest heavily" in order to become the top player in the state.

The expansion into Nevada comes as DraftKings ramps up its efforts to become a global player in the sports betting market. In May, the company acquired Dublin-based regulated sportsbook operator Betfair for $48 million.

With this acquisition, DraftKings now has a presence in five European countries. The company plans to use Betfair's experience in regulated markets to expand further into Europe and other parts of the world.
