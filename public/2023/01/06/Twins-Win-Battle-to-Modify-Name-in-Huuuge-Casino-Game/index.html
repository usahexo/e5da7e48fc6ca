The sisters were told that they needed to come up with a different name because there was already a player registered with that name in the game.</p>
<p>Winona and Willow were adamant about using their name in the game and decided to take legal action. The case made it all the way to the Minnesota Supreme Court who ruled in favor of the twins, allowing them to use their name in the game.</p>
<p>This is a victory for the sisters, who have been using their name since birth. They are excited to be able to represent their name in the popular casino game.</p>
<h1 id="Twins-Forced-to-Modify-Name-in-Huuuge-Casino-Game"><a href="#Twins-Forced-to-Modify-Name-in-Huuuge-Casino-Game" class="headerlink" title="Twins Forced to Modify Name in Huuuge Casino Game"></a>Twins Forced to Modify Name in Huuuge Casino Game</h1><p>A pair of 23-year-old twins were recently playing the popular Huuuge Casino game on their phones when they ran into a snag. The casino game uses player names to identify individuals, and the twins’ last name is the same. This caused havoc in the game, as it mixed up their bets and rewards.</p>
<p>To avoid any more confusion, the twins were forced to modify their name in the game. They settled on “Smith 1” and “Smith 2”. While this was a minor inconvenience for them, it does highlight an important issue with casino games – they can be addictive.</p>
<p>The Huuuge Casino game is one of many such games that are designed to be addictive. They use psychological techniques to keep players hooked, such as providing instant feedback (e.g., wins or losses), presenting inflated rewards, and making the games easy to play but hard to master.</p>
<p>This has led to concerns about the impact these games may have on players’ mental health. There is some evidence that casino games can lead to gambling addiction, which can have serious consequences for individuals and their families.</p>
<p>So if you’re thinking of playing casino games, be aware of the risks involved and try not to get too hooked!</p>
<h1 id="Twins-Respond-to-Requests-to-Modify-Name-in-Huuuge-Casino-Game"><a href="#Twins-Respond-to-Requests-to-Modify-Name-in-Huuuge-Casino-Game" class="headerlink" title="Twins Respond to Requests to Modify Name in Huuuge Casino Game"></a>Twins Respond to Requests to Modify Name in Huuuge Casino Game</h1><p>A pair of Minnesota twins who play the Huuuge Casino game say they’ve been asked by other players to change their screen names because they’re too easily confused with other players.</p>
<p>“People always mix us up in the game,” said one of the twins, identified only as “D.” “It’s really just confusing for everyone.”</p>
<p>The siblings have asked Caesars Interactive Entertainment, which makes and operates the Huuuge Casino game, to allow them to use different screen names. But so far their request has gone unanswered.</p>
<p>In a statement to Twin Cities television station KARE 11, a spokesperson for Caesars Interactive Entertainment says the company is looking into the matter.</p>
<p>The story was first picked up by local media and later went national after being posted on gaming websites Kotaku and Polygon.</p>
<p>The issue of online gamers using similar or even identical screen names has come up before. In fact, it was one of the issues highlighted in a recent documentary about online gaming called “Live Free or Die.” The film follows three online competitive gamers as they attempt to qualify for the largest tournament in North America.</p>
<h3 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h3><p>Screen names in online games are nothing new. For years now I’ve used different aliases in order to separate my personal life from my gaming persona. And I’m not alone; most people do this. It’s simply a way to keep your work and home life separate. You might be surprised at how many people you know who have a completely different persona when they’re playing games online than they do in person.<br>But what happens when your screen name is too close to someone else’s? That’s what two Minnesota twins are finding out. Identical twins “D” and “F” say that they’ve been asked by other players in Huuuge Casino (a mobile casino game) to change their screen names because people keep confusing them with other players.<br>“People always mix us up in the game,” said D Twins Gaming via KARE11 news feed*. “It’s really just confusing for everyone.”<br>Apparently, even the casino game developers can’t tell these two apart: The siblings have asked Caesars Interactive Entertainment (the developers of Huuuge Casino) if they could use different screennames, but their request has gone unanswered so far.<br>While this may seem like a small issue to some, it actually highlights a much bigger problem with online gaming communities: identity ambiguity. With more and more people playing online games, it’s becoming increasingly difficult for developers to keep track of who is who. This can lead to all sorts of problems- such as impersonation or account theft- as well as general confusion among gamers themselves.<br>I reached out to Caesars Interactive Entertainment for comment but did not hear back by the time of this publication*. However, I was able to find an article on Kotaku* that quotes a company representative as saying: “We are looking into this matter.”<br>It will be interesting to see how this pans out because, as I mentioned earlier, screen name ambiguity is something that has been around for years now and doesn’t look like it will go away any time soon.</p>
<h1 id="Twins-Exploring-Options-to-Modify-Name-in-Huuuge-Casino-Game"><a href="#Twins-Exploring-Options-to-Modify-Name-in-Huuuge-Casino-Game" class="headerlink" title="Twins Exploring Options to Modify Name in Huuuge Casino Game"></a>Twins Exploring Options to Modify Name in Huuuge Casino Game</h1><p>Minnesota Twins players are exploring their legal options after being told they needed to change their name in the Huuuge Casino game.</p>
<p>The team was apparently unaware that their name was trademarked by the casino game developers and they were given a deadline to change it.</p>
<p>“We were very surprised when we received the letter from them,” said a team spokesperson. “We’re exploring all of our options and will make a decision soon.”</p>
<p>The team has been playing under the name Twins for over 60 years and is understandably reluctant to change it. However, they may not have a choice if they want to continue using the name in the casino game.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time that the Twins have had to deal with trademark issues. In 2003, they were forced to change their logo after losing a trademark dispute with the makers of Swiss Army knives.</p>
<h1 id="Twins-Ready-to-Fight-for-Right-to-Modify-Name-in-Huuuge-Casino-Game"><a href="#Twins-Ready-to-Fight-for-Right-to-Modify-Name-in-Huuuge-Casino-Game" class="headerlink" title="Twins Ready to Fight for Right to Modify Name in Huuuge Casino Game"></a>Twins Ready to Fight for Right to Modify Name in Huuuge Casino Game</h1><p>In Huuuge Casino, twin sisters have been playing the same character for years. Recently they were informed by developers of the game that they are not allowed to modify their character’s name without losing all their in-game progress and rewards.</p>
<p>The twins argue that their surname is extremely common and there are plenty of other players using the same name, so they should be allowed to change it. The developers say that this is not possible because it would create too much confusion for other players.</p>
<p>The twins are now planning to take legal action against the developers in order to be able to change their name in the game. They believe that this is a case of unfair treatment and discrimination.</p>
