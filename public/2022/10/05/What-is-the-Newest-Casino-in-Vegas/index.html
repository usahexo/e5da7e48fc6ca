<h1 id="What-are-the-Kansas-City-Chiefs"><a href="#What-are-the-Kansas-City-Chiefs" class="headerlink" title="What are the Kansas City Chiefs?"></a>What are the Kansas City Chiefs?</h1><p>The Kansas City Chiefs are a professional American football team based in Kansas City, Missouri. The Chiefs compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league’s American Football Conference (AFC) West division. The team was founded in 1960 as the Dallas Texans by businessman Lamar Hunt and was a charter member of the American Football League (AFL). In 1963, the team relocated to Kansas City and assumed their current name. The Chiefs joined the NFL as a result of the AFL–NFL merger in 1970.</p>
<p>The Chiefs won three AFL championships in 1962, 1966, and 1969. The team’s victory in Super Bowl IV in 1970 represented the first and only time an AFL team won the NFL championship. The Chiefs were also the second team, after the Green Bay Packers, to appear in more than one Super Bowl. They are also the only team to have played in four consecutive AFC Championship Games from 2003 to 2006.</p>
<p>The Kansas City Chiefs franchise was established by Lamar Hunt on August 22, 1960, as the Dallas Texans, with help from Clint Murchison Jr., who had purchased half ownership in the original Houston Oilers from Bud Adams. Wilkinson purchased half of the Texans for $25,000 before agreeing to move them to Kansas City. After All-America defensive back Johnny Robinson was drafted by Dallas with the 10th overall pick of the 1960 NFL draft, Hunt negotiated unsuccessfully with Titans owner K.S. “Bud” Adams about buying that franchise and moving it to Dallas. Although he was initially hesitant to continue his pro football investment after relocating his family’s welfare hotel business during an oil boom downturn,[1] Hunt eventually decided to start a new pro football league, signing Drew Pearson and other players from the disbanding Minnesota Vikings squad.[2]</p>
<p>Hunt then approached several NFL owners about future franchises in Houston and St. Louis; however Bob Howsam beat him out in St Louis with an ownership offer for Cardinals.[3][4] Unable to secure a expansion franchise or buy an existing club,[5] Hunt began negotiations with six other AFL owners (Al Davis, Barron Hilton, Max Winter, Jim Nordstrom, Marty Sklar and Ralph Wilson) about starting a new league with a new championship game.[6][7] On August 22, 1960, at Hofheinz Pavilion on the University of Houston campus,[8][9] Hunt announced that he had secured financing for a new professional football league called “the American Football League”.[10][11][12] Under terms of its charter granted by Congress two years earlier,[13]:p orbidden Texas enterprises from owning more than one professional sports franchise[14], Lamar transferred ownership of both franchises to his wife Norma after learning that it would be unsuccessful attempting to own two separate NFL clubs (the Los Angeles Chargers having been already awarded while they were still located in AFL-Los Angeles).<a href="pp115%E2%80%93117">15</a> </p>
<p>In October 1960, Hunt moved his team from Dallas to Kansas City and renamed them the Chiefs after Mayor Bartle’s nickname.[16]:p On November 27, 1962 – only 2 years after their formation – KCs hosted their very first home game against Denver Broncos (then wearing burgundy uniforms) which resulted in 7-0 forfeit victory for KC as Broncos failed to appear on field due to blizzard conditions;[17]:p 6 however attendance lagged behind expectations due partly because many residents were not yet familiar with American football.[18]:pp49–50 In 1963 Hunt and Wilkerson negotiated unsuccessfully with Cardinals owner Charles Bidwill Sr. for relocation of Cardinals franchise to Kansas City after Bidwill expressed interest in moving his club eastward.[19]:p206 A few weeks later on January 16, 1964 HOU relocated Balmer &amp; Lawless Coach Factory OutletLamar moved forward with plans founders day celebrationfor inaugural season at new Municipal Stadium;[20]:ix however delays obtaining approval for municipal bonds meant opening day would be pushed back one year later finally taking place on September 11 versus Oakland Raiders;[21]:p92 In their last game prior entertainment complex built downtown kansas city prior 1973 season kansas city chiefs finished 4-10 including 0-8 at home kansas city royals meanwhile finished above .500 winning world series both franchises helped drive construction sales within metropolitan area although seating capacity baseball stadium would prove too small for professional footballteam relocated one block east along wilshire boulevard shared site originally proposed by houston oilman john murchison jr1966 saw addition 3″ turf goal posts reduced crowd noise levelsfrom 26 dba up 66% getting concessionaire at&amp;t signed 3 coffee vending machines providing complimentary coffee service all fans during gamesplayed every down 1961-1972 seasonsat arrowhead stadiumkansas city chiefs hall fame quarterback len dawson elected into pro football hall fame 1983along ozzie newsome ray nitschkebob sandersfrank giffordantonio brownwillie jeffersond</p>
<h1 id="How-many-points-will-the-Chiefs-score-against-the-Raiders"><a href="#How-many-points-will-the-Chiefs-score-against-the-Raiders" class="headerlink" title="How many points will the Chiefs score against the Raiders?"></a>How many points will the Chiefs score against the Raiders?</h1><p>The Kansas City Chiefs and the Oakland Raiders are scheduled to play this Thursday night. The odds makers have the Chiefs as a touchdown favorite. </p>
<p>The Chiefs have one of the best offenses in the NFL. Quarterback Patrick Mahomes has thrown for 2,180 yards and 26 touchdowns this season. The Chiefs also have running back Kareem Hunt who is averaging 5.2 yards per carry. The Chiefs should be able to put up a lot of points against the Raiders defense.</p>
<p>The Raiders have not been very good this season. They are 1-7 and have the worst defense in the NFL. They are giving up an average of 33.9 points per game. The Raiders will not be able to keep up with the Chiefs offense and will likely lose by a lot of points.</p>
<h1 id="Is-this-the-year-the-Chiefs-make-it-to-the-Superbowl"><a href="#Is-this-the-year-the-Chiefs-make-it-to-the-Superbowl" class="headerlink" title="Is this the year the Chiefs make it to the Superbowl?"></a>Is this the year the Chiefs make it to the Superbowl?</h1><p>The 2017 NFL regular season is coming to a close, and for the Kansas City Chiefs, it has been a roller coaster of a year. Currently, they are in first place in the AFC West with a 10-4 record. Many experts are saying that this may be the year the Chiefs make it to the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>One of the biggest reasons for their success this season is the play of their quarterback, Alex Smith. He is having one of his best seasons ever, throwing for over 3,000 yards and 19 touchdowns. The Chiefs also have a strong running game thanks to rookie Kareem Hunt, who has already rushed for 1,292 yards and 10 touchdowns.</p>
<p>On defense, the Chiefs have been led by linebacker Justin Houston, who has 9 sacks this season. Overall, the Chiefs have a well-balanced team that is capable of making a run at the Super Bowl this year.</p>
<p>However, they will not be able to take things for granted down the stretch. They still have two games left against division rivals Oakland Raiders and Denver Broncos. If they can win those games and finish with a 12-4 record or better, then there’s no doubt that they will be headed to Super Bowl 52.</p>
<h1 id="Who-will-be-the-starting-quarterback-for-the-Chiefs-this-year"><a href="#Who-will-be-the-starting-quarterback-for-the-Chiefs-this-year" class="headerlink" title="Who will be the starting quarterback for the Chiefs this year?"></a>Who will be the starting quarterback for the Chiefs this year?</h1><p>Recent reports suggest that Patrick Mahomes will be the starting quarterback for the Kansas City Chiefs this year. This is a big change for the Chiefs, who have been led by longtime QB Alex Smith in recent years. Mahomes is a much younger player, and has shown potential in preseason games.</p>
<p>Many Chiefs fans are excited about this change. Mahomes is a strong passer who can also run well. He is likely to bring some excitement to the Chiefs’ offense this year. Smith has been a reliable player, but he doesn’t have the same level of talent as Mahomes.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how Mahomes performs this year. The Chiefs have a good team, and they should be able to compete for a playoff spot. If Mahomes can play well and lead the team to victory, he will likely become one of the most popular players in Kansas City.</p>
