        <h1 id="Nigeria-to-split-2-1-billion-among-36-states"><a href="#Nigeria-to-split-2-1-billion-among-36-states" class="headerlink" title="Nigeria to split $2.1 billion among 36 states"></a>Nigeria to split $2.1 billion among 36 states</h1><p>The Nigerian Federal Government has announced that it will be splitting $2.1 billion among the 36 states of the federation.</p>
<p>The money, which is made up of revenue generated from the sale of petrol and diesel, will be used to help finance the development programmes of the states.</p>
<p>In a statement released by the Minister for Budget and National Planning, Udoma Udo Udoma, it was revealed that each state would receive a minimum of N5.5 billion.</p>
<p>Udoma said: “This gesture is in addition to the N710 billion already released to the states since January this year.”</p>
<p>Governors across Nigeria have welcomed the news, with many pledging to use the money to improve infrastructure and boost economic development.</p>
<p>Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State said: “The release of this amount is very encouraging and a clear demonstration of President Buhari’s commitment to ensuring that all parts of Nigeria benefit from national resources.”</p>
<p>While Governor Akinwunmi Ambode of Lagos State pledged to use his state’s share “to improve infrastructures such as roads, bridges, hospitals, schools and water supply”.</p>
<h1 id="Blackjack-What-Does-Twice-Do"><a href="#Blackjack-What-Does-Twice-Do" class="headerlink" title="Blackjack: What Does Twice Do?"></a>Blackjack: What Does Twice Do?</h1><p>In blackjack, when the dealer has a ten or an ace exposed and there are no other players at the table, the player has the option of taking “double down.” This means that the player is allowed to double their bet, and they will only be given one more card. The player must then stand (not take any more cards).</p>
<p>What is the rationale for doubling down in this situation? Most would say that since the dealer already has a strong hand, your chances of beating them are low. So, you might as well double your bet and hope to get a lucky card that gives you a better chance of winning.</p>
<p>But what if you’re playing with multiple players? In this case, doubling down may not be the best play. For example, if there are two other players at the table and the dealer has an ace exposed, it’s likely that at least one of them will also have an ace. If both players hit (take another card), the dealer is likely to end up with a blackjack (21) and both players will lose.</p>
<p>In this situation, it might be wiser to simply stand rather than doubling down and risking losing even more money.</p>
<h1 id="Nigeria-to-get-2-1-billion-from-IMF"><a href="#Nigeria-to-get-2-1-billion-from-IMF" class="headerlink" title="Nigeria to get $2.1 billion from IMF"></a>Nigeria to get $2.1 billion from IMF</h1><p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has announced a package of support funds totaling $2.1 billion for Nigeria. The money is designed to help the government of Africa’s most populous country stabilize its economy and rebuild growth.</p>
<p>The IMF’s head, Christine Lagarde, made the announcement during a visit to the Nigerian capital of Abuja. She said the money would be disbursed in several installments over the next year, and would come with strings attached in the form of economic reforms intended to improve transparency and reduce corruption.</p>
<p>“The package we are announcing today is aimed at helping Nigeria restore growth, increase transparency, and strengthen economic institutions,” Lagarde said.</p>
<p>Nigeria’s economy has been struggling in recent years due to falling oil prices and rampant corruption. The downturn has sparked rising unemployment and inflation, as well as a currency crisis. In response, the Nigerian government has imposed austerity measures that have led to social unrest.</p>
<p>The IMF package is seen as a vote of confidence in the Nigerian government’s efforts to fix its economy. It will also help shore up foreign reserves and provide much-needed funding for infrastructure projects.</p>
<h1 id="Second-time’s-a-charm-as-Nigeria-scores-bailout-from-IMF"><a href="#Second-time’s-a-charm-as-Nigeria-scores-bailout-from-IMF" class="headerlink" title="Second time’s a charm as Nigeria scores bailout from IMF"></a>Second time’s a charm as Nigeria scores bailout from IMF</h1><p>Africa’s most populous country gets a bailout from the IMF for the second time in just over a year, as the government seeks to revive an economy hammered by a collapse in oil prices.</p>
<p>ABUJA&#x2F;LAGOS - Nigeria has secured $1 billion in bailout funds from the International Monetary Fund, its second such loan within a year, as the government seeks to revive an economy hammered by a collapse in oil prices.</p>
<p>The three-year loan was approved by the IMF’s executive board on Wednesday, following months of talks with Nigerian officials.</p>
<p>“The program will help reduce vulnerabilities and support growth which has slowed markedly due to global headwinds,” IMF deputy managing director David Lipton said in a statement.</p>
<p>The new loan is smaller than the $6 billion Nigeria secured last year, but it underscores the continued fragility of Africa’s largest economy. Crude oil sales account for around 70% of government revenue and 95% of exports.</p>
<p>Nigeria entered recession for the first time in 25 years in 2016 and inflation reached 18.7% in May. The naira has lost more than half its value against the dollar on the black market since 2015 as dollar shortages have taken hold.</p>
<p>In April, President Muhammadu Buhari announced plans to borrow up to $5 billion from local banks to fund infrastructure projects and stimulate growth. Analysts say Nigeria also needs to find ways to raise revenue and attract foreign investment.</p>
<h1 id="Nigeria-doubles-down-scores-2-1-billion-from-IMF"><a href="#Nigeria-doubles-down-scores-2-1-billion-from-IMF" class="headerlink" title="Nigeria doubles down, scores $2.1 billion from IMF"></a>Nigeria doubles down, scores $2.1 billion from IMF</h1><p>In a move that is set to please the IMF, Nigeria has announced it will double down on its reform efforts, which have already seen it score a $2.1 billion bailout loan.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Zainab Ahmed made the announcement on Wednesday, noting that Nigeria was committed to working with the IMF to improve governance and revive the economy. The minister pointed out that more work needed to be done in areas such as improving public financial management, fighting corruption and reforming state-owned enterprises.</p>
<p>“The $2.1 billion disbursement is an endorsement of our reform efforts and a vote of confidence in the Nigerian government’s ability to implement structural reforms that will restore growth and investor confidence in our economy,” Ahmed said in a statement.</p>
<p>Nigeria secured the loan in June after agreeing to a number of stringent conditions, including carrying out a review of its foreign exchange policy and adopting measures to boost tax revenue. The country has been struggling with an economic recession since 2016, caused by low oil prices and the impact of Boko Haram insurgency in the north-east.</p>
<p>The IMF says Nigeria needs to implement “comprehensive and deep-seated reforms” to revive growth. In a report released last month, it forecast that the Nigerian economy would grow by 2% this year, up from 1.5% in 2018.</p>
